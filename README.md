# ICS4U Scripts

About this repo
---------------

These are a bunch of scripts that I was tasked to answer while I was on my last year of high school (ICS4U)

I decided to upload it here for archival reasons.

I may or may not update the scripts in the future.

See the [outline](https://sites.google.com/site/mrliconti/ics4u-python) for more details.
